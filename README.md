## Overview

FitLife is a Laravel-based fitness platform that merges personal tracking with community features. It covers the day-to-day health workflow of a user, then layers social discovery, direct messages, group chats, polls, notifications, and moderation on top.

Instead of splitting the experience across multiple small tools, FitLife keeps nutrition, hydration, sleep, goals, progress photos, profile management, posts, messaging, and admin workflows in one codebase.

> The result is a product that feels part tracker, part social app, and part messaging hub.

## Product Behaviors Worth Noting

| Behavior | How it works |
|:---------|:-------------|
| Nutrition lookup | Uses CalorieNinjas when configured, otherwise falls back to local food data |
| Sleep duration | Handles overnight sleep sessions by carrying end time into the next day when needed |
| Online state | Uses `last_seen_at` tracking to approximate recent presence |
| Feed ranking | Supports multiple feed modes, including a time-sensitive hot sort |
| Messaging updates | Uses polling endpoints for new messages, typing status, and history loading |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.2+
- Composer
- Node.js and npm
- MySQL or PostgreSQL

### Installation

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd FitLife_new

composer install
npm install

cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

### Configure Environment

Set your application and database values in `.env`.

Minimum setup usually includes:

- `APP_NAME`
- `APP_URL`
- `DB_CONNECTION`
- `DB_HOST`
- `DB_PORT`
- `DB_DATABASE`
- `DB_USERNAME`
- `DB_PASSWORD`

Optional service keys:

- `CALORIENINJAS_KEY` for nutrition lookup
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI-backed features

### Database and Storage

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
php artisan storage:link
```

### Run in Development

Option 1: start backend and frontend separately.

```bash
php artisan serve
npm run dev
```

Option 2: use the combined workflow defined in `composer.json`.

```bash
composer dev
```

`composer dev` starts:

- Laravel development server
- Queue listener
- Laravel Pail log stream
- Vite development server

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
php artisan serve
```

## Testing & Quality

```bash
php artisan test
./vendor/bin/pest
./vendor/bin/pest --parallel
./vendor/bin/pint
```

Use `composer test` if you want the framework test runner after a config clear.

## Integrations

| Service | Purpose |
|:--------|:--------|
| CalorieNinjas | Nutrition lookup with calories and macro data |
| OpenAI PHP for Laravel | Foundation for AI-powered features |

## Database Restore

The repository includes a backup file named `fitlife_backup.sql` at the project root.

Example MySQL restore:

```bash
mysql -u <user> -p <database_name> < fitlife_backup.sql
```

After restoring, apply any pending migrations and relink storage if needed.

```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan storage:link
```
